### Description

- Players have to guess words shown on the screen
- Dashes are shown to the user where they have to guess the missing letter/letters.
- Word will only be shown once they are able to guess correctly.
- Player is allowed a limited amount of guesses till they run out of life.

### Getting Started

I'll need a database of words from which the user can guess.
I'll need to keep track of the amount guesses used and the amount of life remaining.
Will decrement their life for every wrong guess.
Will need to implement a rule that determines that the player has won.
